Health Check
============

One can verify this image is working as expected
by 1) building it via:

``docker build -t genai-tech-screen .``

and 2) executing it via

``docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<key> -i genai-tech-screen``

If all goes well a sample dataframe shall be sent to OpenAI
for a sample response.
